# CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION

## PREAMBLE

The Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, comprising Ada holders, individuals, builders,
developers, enterprises, stake pools, users of the Cardano Blockchain and
others, operates in a truly decentralized manner.

Recognizing the need for a dynamic governance framework, one that utilizes
wherever possible blockchain technology in the governance process, the Cardano
community hereby establishes this Cardano Constitution. It shall serve as a set
of principles for the operation and governance of an environment where all
participants can contribute to the betterment of the Cardano Blockchain
ecosystem.

The Cardano community shall uphold principles of transparency, openness, and
responsible governance, promoting a culture of trust and collaboration.
Together, the Cardano community commits to uphold these principles and to work
together towards the continuous improvement, growth, and success of our
decentralized blockchain ecosystem known as the Cardano Blockchain.

All members of the Cardano community are entitled to participate in its
governance processes, and are encouraged to work collaboratively towards the
betterment of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, contributing to its growth,
sustainability, and success. The Cardano Blockchain shall be governed on a
vote-based decision-making model, fostering inclusivity, a diversity of views,
innovation and adaptability.

## ARTICLE I. CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN TENETS AND GUARDRAILS

### Section 1

These Tenets shall guide all actors in the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem and
proposed governance actions shall be evaluated in accordance with these Tenets.

Transactions on the Cardano Blockchain should not be slowed down or censored and
should be expediently served for their intended purpose. The Cardano Blockchain
should scale.

The cost of transactions on the Cardano Blockchain should be predictable.

The Cardano Blockchain shall not lock an Ada owner’s value without owner’s
consent. The Cardano Blockchain should promote interoperability.

The Cardano Blockchain shall preserve in a safe manner any information an owner
of Ada seeks to store on the Cardano Blockchain.

All users of the Cardano Blockchain shall be treated equally.

### Section 2

The Cardano Blockchain shall operate in accordance with the Guardrails as set
forth in the Guardrails Appendix to this Constitution.

## ARTICLE II. THE CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN COMMUNITY

### Section 1

No membership shall be required to use, participate in and benefit from the
Cardano Blockchain. All owners of Ada, all developers of, all those building on,
and all those otherwise supporting, maintaining or using the Cardano Blockchain
are beneficiaries of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem and, as such, are
collectively members of the Cardano community. All Cardano community members are
accordingly beneficiaries of this Constitution, entitled to its rights,
privileges and protections and, as such, are expected to support and uphold this
Constitution.

### Section 2

Members of the Cardano community who own Ada are entitled to access and
participate in the on-chain decision-making processes of the Cardano Blockchain
ecosystem, including voting.

## ARTICLE III. PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE

### Section 1

The Cardano Blockchain ecosystem shall be governed by an on-chain governance
model, utilizing, to the extent possible, smart contracts and other
blockchain-based tools to facilitate decision-making and transparency. On-chain
voting for governance actions shall follow the process outlined in the Cardano
Blockchain Guardrails.

### Section 2

Three governance bodies shall participate in voting for on-chain governance
actions to provide checks and balances for the Cardano Blockchain consisting of
Delegated Representatives (dRep), Stake Pool Operators (SPO) and the
Constitutional Committee (CC).

### Section 3

On-chain governance decisions shall be made through a collective decision-making
process, with specific consensus threshold requirements as required by the
Cardano Blockchain Guardrails. All on-chain governance actions shall be voted
upon in accordance with the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

### Section 4

All owners of Ada shall have the right to vote in on-chain governance action
processes, subject to any restrictions or requirements provided for in this
Constitution and the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

### Section 5

Any proposed on-chain governance action shall require a standardized and legible
format including a URI and hash linked to documented content. Sufficient
rationale shall be provided to justify the requested change to the Cardano
Blockchain. The rationale shall include, at a minimum, a title, abstract, reason
for the proposal, and supporting materials.

“Hard Fork Initiation” and “Protocol Parameter Change” governance actions should
undergo sufficient technical review and scrutiny as mandated by the Cardano
Blockchain Guardrails to ensure that the governance action does not endanger the
security, functionality or performance of the Cardano Blockchain. On-chain
governance actions' rationale should address their expected impact on the
Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.

### Section 6

The Cardano community is expected to enact, not less than on an annual basis, a
budget for the ongoing maintenance and future development of the Cardano
Blockchain. No withdrawals from the Cardano treasury shall be permitted unless a
budget for the Cardano Blockchain is then in effect as required by the Cardano
Blockchain Guardrails.

## ARTICLE IV. DELEGATED REPRESENTATIVES

### Section 1

In order to participate in governance actions, owners of Ada may register as
dReps and vote on governance actions or may delegate their voting rights to
other registered dReps who shall vote on their behalf.

### Section 2

dReps may be individuals or coordinated groups. dReps are entitled to cast votes
directly for on-chain governance actions and represent those Ada holders
delegating their voting rights to them.

## ARTICLE V. STAKE POOL OPERATORS

### Section 1

SPOs shall have a specific role in approving critical on-chain governance
actions which require additional oversight and independence, voting separately
and independently of dReps as set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.
SPOs shall participate in hard fork initiation processes as the operators of the
nodes that participate in Cardano Blockchain’s consensus mechanism.

### Section 2

SPOs act as a check on the power of the Constitutional Committee by separately
voting on "Motion of no-confidence" and "Update committee/threshold" governance
actions.

## ARTICLE VI. CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE

### Section 1

A Constitutional Committee shall be established as the branch of Cardano's
on-chain governance process that ensures governance actions are consistent with
this Constitution. The Constitutional Committee shall be limited to voting on
the constitutionality of governance actions.

### Section 2

The Constitutional Committee shall be composed as consistent with the Cardano
Blockchain Guardrails.

Members of the Constitutional Committee shall serve such terms as consistent
with the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails, provided that terms shall not be less
than one year. To assure continuity in the operation of Constitutional
Committee, the terms for Constitutional Committee members shall be staggered.

### Section 3

The Cardano community shall establish a process from time to time for election
of members of the Constitutional Committee consistent with the requirements of
the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

### Section 4

No governance action, other than a "Motion of no-confidence" or "Update
constitutional committee/threshold" may be implemented on-chain unless the
Constitutional Committee shall have first determined and affirmed through an
on-chain action that such proposal does not violate this Constitution.

The Constitutional Committee shall be considered to be in one of the following
two states at all times: a state of confidence or a state of no-confidence. In a
state of no-confidence, members of the then standing Constitutional Committee
must be reinstated or replaced using the "Update committee/threshold" governance
action before any other on-chain governance action may go forward.

### Section 5

The Constitutional Committee should operate pursuant to a standard operating
procedure published by the Constitutional Committee and shall adopt such
policies and procedures as the Constitutional Committee shall deem necessary in
carrying out its duties.

## ARTICLE VII. AMENDMENTS

### Section 1

Except as otherwise so provided in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix,
amendments to this Constitution, including to the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails
Appendix, shall be approved by a collective decision-making process, requiring
an on-chain governance action by owners of Ada satisfying a threshold of not
less than 67% of the then active voting stake.

## APPENDIX I: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS

### 1. INTRODUCTION

This Appendix sets forth guardrails that must be applied to Cardano Blockchain
on-chain governance actions, including changes to the protocol parameters and
limits on treasury withdrawals.

These guardrails are designed to avoid unexpected problems with the operation of
the Cardano Blockchain. They are intended to guide the choice of parameter
settings and avoid potential problems with security, performance or
functionality.

These guardrails apply to the Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 mainnet environment.
They are not intended to apply to test environments or to other blockchains that
use the Cardano Blockchain software.

The guardrails set forth in this Appendix may be amended pursuant to an on-chain
governance action that satisfies the applicable voting threshold set forth in
this Appendix.

### Terminology and Guidance

**Should/Should not.** Where this Appendix says that a value "should not" be set
below or above some value, this means that the guardrail is a recommendation or
guideline, and the specific value could be open to discussion or alteration by a
suitably expert group recognized by the Cardano community.

**Must/Must not.** Where this Appendix says that a value "must not" be set below
or above some value, this means that the guardrail is a requirement that will be
enforced by Cardano Blockchain ledger rules, types or other built-in mechanisms
where possible, and that if not followed could cause a protocol failure,
security breach or other undesirable outcome.

**Benchmarking.** Benchmarking refers to careful system level performance
evaluation that is designed to show a-priori that, for example, 95% of blocks
will be diffused across a global network of Cardano Blockchain nodes within the
required 5s time interval in all cases.

**Performance analysis.** Performance analysis refers to projecting theoretical
performance, empirical benchmarking or simulation results to predict actual
system behavior.

**Simulation.** Simulation refers to synthetic execution that is designed to
inform performance/functionality decisions in a repeatable way.

**Performance Monitoring.** Performance monitoring involves measuring the actual
behavior of the Cardano Blockchain network. It complements benchmarking and
performance analysis by providing information about actual system behavior that
cannot be obtained using simulated workloads or theoretical analysis.

**Reverting Changes.** Where performance monitoring shows that actual network
behavior following a change is inconsistent with the performance requirements
for the Cardano Blockchain, then the change must be reverted to its previous
state if that is possible. For example, if the block size is increased from
100KB to 120KB and 95% of blocks are no longer diffused within 5s, then a change
must be made to revert the block size to 100KB. If this is not possible, then
one or more alternative changes must be made that will ensure that the
performance requirements are met.

**Severity Levels.** Issues that affect the Cardano Blockchain network are
classified by severity level, where:

- Severity 1 is a critical incident or issue with very high impact to the
  security, performance, or functionality of the Cardano Blockchain network.
- Severity 2 is a major incident or issue with significant impact to the
  security, performance, or functionality of the Cardano Blockchain network.
- Severity 3 is a minor incident or issue with low impact to the security,
  performance, or functionality of the Cardano Blockchain network.

### Automated Checking ("Guardrails Script")

A script hash is associated with the constitution hash when a **New Constitution
or Guardrails Script** governance action is enacted. It acts as an additional
safeguard to the ledger rules and types, filtering non-compliant governance
actions.

The guardrails script only affects two types of governance actions:

- **Parameter Update** actions, and
- **Treasury Withdrawal** actions.

The script is executed when either of these types of governance action is
submitted on-chain. There are three different situations that apply to script
usage.

**Symbol and Explanation**

- (y) The script can be used to enforce the guardrail.
- (x) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail.
- (~ - reason) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail for the reason
  given, but future ledger changes could enable this.

Guardrails may overlap: in this case, the most restrictive set of guardrails
will apply.

> **IMPORTANT**
> Where a parameter is not explicitly listed in this document, then the script *
> *must not** permit any changes to the parameter.

Conversely, where a parameter is explicitly listed in this document but no
checkable guardrails are specified, the script **must not** impose any
constraints on changes to the parameter.

### 2. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON PROTOCOL PARAMETER UPDATE ACTIONS

Below are guardrails and guidelines for changing updatable protocol parameter
settings via the protocol parameter update governance action such that the
Cardano Blockchain is never in an unrecoverable state as a result of such
changes.

Note that there are at least five different sources of parameter names, and
these are not always consistent:

1. The name used in the Genesis file
2. The name used in protocol parameter update governance actions
3. The name used internally in ledger rules
4. The name used in the formal ledger specification
5. The name used in research papers

Where these parameter names differ, this Appendix uses the second convention.

#### Guardrails

**PARAM-01** (y) Any protocol parameter that is not explicitly named in this
document **must not** be changed by a Parameter update governance action.

**PARAM-02** (y) Where a protocol parameter is explicitly listed in this
document but no checkable guardrails are specified, the guardrails script **must
not** impose any constraints on changes to the parameter. Checkable guardrails
are shown by a (y).

### 2.1. Critical Protocol Parameters

The below protocol parameters are critical from a security point of view.

_Parameters that are Critical to the Operation of the Blockchain_

- *maximum block body size* (*maxBlockBodySize*)
- *maximum transaction size* (*maxTxSize*)
- *maximum block header size* (*maxBlockHeaderSize*)
- *maximum size of a serialized asset value* (*maxValueSize*)
- *maximum script execution/memory units in a single block* (
  *maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps/memory]*)
- *minimum fee coefficient* (*txFeePerByte*)
- *minimum fee constant* (*txFeeFixed*)
- *minimum fee per byte for reference scripts* (*minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte*)
- *minimum Lovelace deposit per byte of serialized UTxO* (*utxoCostPerByte*)
- *governance action deposit* (*govDeposit*)

#### Guardrails

**PARAM-03** (y) Critical protocol parameters require an SPO vote in addition to
a dRep vote: SPOs **must** say "yes" with a collective support of more than 50%
of all active block production stake. This is enforced by the guardrails on the
stake pool voting threshold.

**PARAM-04** (x) At least 3 months **should** normally pass between the
publication of an off-chain proposal to change a critical protocol parameter and
the submission of the corresponding on-chain governance action. This guardrail
may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue
following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

_Parameters that are Critical to the Governance System_

- *delegation key Lovelace deposit* (*stakeAddressDeposit*)
- *pool registration Lovelace deposit* (*stakePoolDeposit*)
- *minimum fixed rewards cut for pools* (*minPoolCost*)
- *dRep deposit amount* (*dRepDeposit*)
- *minimal Constitutional Committee size* (*committeeMinSize*)
- *maximum term length (in epochs) for the Constitutional Committee members* (
  *committeeMaxTermLimit*)

#### Guardrails

**PARAM-05** (y) dReps **must** vote "yes" with a collective support of more
than 50% of all active voting stake. This is enforced by the guardrails on the
dRep voting thresholds.

**PARAM-06** (x) At least 3 months **should** normally pass between the
publication of an off-chain proposal to change a parameter that is critical to
the governance system and the submission of the corresponding on-chain
governance action. This guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or
Severity 2 network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

### 2.2. Economic Parameters

The overall goals when managing economic parameters are to:

1. Enable long-term economic sustainability for the Cardano Blockchain
   ecosystem;
2. Ensure that stake pools are adequately rewarded for maintaining the Cardano
   Blockchain;
3. Ensure that Ada holders are adequately rewarded for using stake in
   constructive ways, including when delegating Ada for block production; and
4. Balance economic incentives for different Cardano Blockchain ecosystem
   stakeholders, including but not limited to Stake Pool Operators, Ada holders,
   DeFi users, infrastructure users, developers (e.g., DApps), and financial
   intermediaries (e.g., exchanges).

_Triggers for Change_

1. Significant changes in the fiat value of Ada resulting in potential problems
   with security, performance, or functionality.
2. Changes in transaction volumes or types.
3. Community requests or suggestions.
4. Emergency situations that require changes to economic parameters.

_Counter-indicators_

Changes to the economic parameters should not be made in isolation. They need to
account for:

- External economic factors.
- Network security concerns.

_Core Metrics_

- Fiat value of Ada resulting in potential problems with security, performance,
  or functionality.
- Transaction volumes and types.
- Number and health of stake pools.
- External economic factors.

_Changes to Specific Economic Parameters_

**Transaction fee per byte (txFeePerByte) and fixed transaction fee (txFeeFixed)
**

Defines the cost for basic transactions in Lovelace:

fee(tx) = txFeeFixed + txFeePerByte x nBytes(tx)

#### Guardrails

**TFPB-01** (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** be lower than 30 (0.000030 Ada).
This protects against low-cost denial of service attacks.

**TFPB-02** (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** exceed 1,000 (0.001 Ada). This
ensures that transactions can be paid for.

**TFPB-03** (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** be negative.

**TFF-01** (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** be lower than 100,000 (0.1 Ada). This
protects against low-cost denial of service attacks.

**TFF-02** (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** exceed 10,000,000 (10 Ada). This
ensures that transactions can be paid for.

**TFF-03** (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** be negative.

**TFGEN-01** (x - "should") To maintain a consistent level of protection against
denial-of-service attacks, *txFeeFixed* and *txFeePerByte* **should** be
adjusted whenever Plutus Execution prices are adjusted (
executionUnitPrices[steps/memory]).

**TFGEN-02** (x - unquantifiable) Any changes to *txFeeFixed* or *txFeePerByte*
**must** consider the implications of reducing the cost of a denial-of-service
attack or increasing the maximum transaction fee so that it becomes impossible
to construct a transaction.

_UTxO cost per byte (utxoCostPerByte)_

Defines the cost for storage in UTxOs:

- Sets a minimum threshold on Ada that is held within a single UTxO (~1 Ada
  minimum, could be >= 50 Ada in the worst case).
- Provides protection against low-cost denial of service attack on UTxO storage.
  This attack has been executed on other chains; it is not theoretical.
- DoS protection decreases in line with the free node memory (proportional to
  UTxO growth).
- Helps reduce long-term storage costs.
- Provides an incentive to return UTxOs when no longer needed.
- Should significantly exceed minimum tx cost (~0.15 Ada).

#### Guardrails

**UCPB-01** (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be lower than 3,000 (0.003 Ada).

**UCPB-02** (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** exceed 6,500 (0.0065 Ada).

**UCPB-03** (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be zero.

**UCPB-04** (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be negative.

**UCPB-05** (x - "should") Changes **should** account for:

i) The acceptable cost of attack. ii) The acceptable time for an attack (at
least one epoch is assumed). iii) The acceptable memory configuration for full
node users (assumed to be 16GB for wallets or 24GB for stake pools). iv) The
sizes of UTxOs (~200B per UTxO minimum, up to about 10KB). v) The current total
node memory usage.

_Stake address deposit (stakeAddressDeposit)_

Ensures that stake addresses are retired when no longer needed:

- Helps reduce long-term storage costs.
- Helps limit CPU and memory costs in the ledger.

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are
returned when they are no longer required. Reducing the number of active stake
addresses also reduces processing and memory costs at the epoch boundary when
calculating stake snapshots.

#### Guardrails

**SAD-01** (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** be lower than 1,000,000 (1
Ada).

**SAD-02** (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** exceed 5,000,000 (5 Ada).

**SAD-03** (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** be negative.

_Stake pool deposit (stakePoolDeposit)_

Ensures that stake pools are retired by the stake pool operator when no longer
needed by them:

- Helps reduce long-term storage costs.

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are
returned when they are no longer required. Rewards and stake snapshot
calculations are also impacted by the number of active stake pools.

#### Guardrails

**SPD-01** (y) *stakePoolDeposit* **must not** be lower than 250,000,000 (250
Ada).

**SPD-02** (y) *stakePoolDeposit* **must not** exceed 500,000,000 (500 Ada).

**SPD-03** (y) *stakePoolDeposit* **must not** be negative.

_Minimum Pool Cost (minPoolCost)_

Part of the rewards mechanism:

- The minimum pool cost is transferred to the pool rewards address before any
  delegator rewards are paid.

#### Guardrails

**MPC-01** (y) *minPoolCost* **must not** be negative.

**MPC-02** (y) *minPoolCost* **must not** exceed 500,000,000 (500 Ada).

**MPC-03** (x - "should") *minPoolCost* **should** be set in line with the
economic cost for operating a pool.

__Treasury Cut (treasuryCut)_

Part of the rewards mechanism:

- The treasury cut portion of the monetary expansion is transferred to the
  treasury before any pool rewards are paid.
- Can be set in the range 0.0-1.0 (0%-100%).

#### Guardrails

**TC-01** (y) *treasuryCut* **must not** be lower than 0.1 (10%).

**TC-02** (y) *treasuryCut* **must not** exceed 0.3 (30%).

**TC-03** (y) *treasuryCut* **must not** be negative.

**TC-04** (y) *treasuryCut* **must not** exceed 1.0 (100%).

**TC-05** (~ - no access to change history) *treasuryCut* **must not** be
changed more than once in any 36-epoch period (approximately 6 months).

_Monetary Expansion Rate (monetaryExpansion)_

Part of the rewards mechanism:

- The monetary expansion controls the amount of reserves that is used for
  rewards each epoch.
- Governs the long-term sustainability of Cardano.
- The reserves are gradually depleted until no rewards are supplied.

#### Guardrails

**ME-01** (y) *monetaryExpansion* **must not** exceed 0.

**ME-02** (y) *monetaryExpansion* **must not** be lower than 0.

**ME-03** (y) *monetaryExpansion* **must not** be negative.

**ME-04** (x - "should") *monetaryExpansion* **should not** be varied by more
than +/- 10% in any 73-epoch period (approximately 12 months).

**ME-05** (x - "should") *monetaryExpansion* **should not** be changed more than
once in any 36-epoch period (approximately 6 months).

_Plutus Script Execution Prices (executionUnitPrices[priceSteps/priceMemory])_

Defines the fees for executing Plutus scripts:

- Gives an economic return for Plutus script execution.
- Provides security against low-cost DoS attacks.

#### Guardrails

**EIUP-PS-01** (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceSteps]* **must not** exceed 2,000 /
10,000,000.

**EIUP-PS-02** (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceSteps]* **must not** be lower than
500 / 10,000,000.

**EIUP-PM-01** (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceMemory]* **must not** exceed
2,000 / 10,000.

**EIUP-PM-02** (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceMemory]* **must not** be lower than
400 / 10,000.

**EIUP-GEN-01** (x - "similar to") The execution prices **must** be set so that:

- i) the cost of executing a transaction with maximum CPU steps is similar to
  the cost of a maximum-sized non-script transaction and
- ii) the cost of executing a transaction with maximum memory units is similar
  to the cost of a maximum-sized non-script transaction.

**EIUP-GEN-02** (x - "should") The execution prices **should** be adjusted
whenever transaction fees are adjusted (*txFeeFixed/txFeePerByte*). The goal is
to ensure that the processing delay is similar for "full" transactions,
regardless of their type.

- This helps ensure that the requirements on block diffusion/propagation times
  are met.

_Transaction fee per byte for a reference script (minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte)_

Defines the cost for using Plutus reference scripts in Lovelace.

#### Guardrails

**MFRS-01** (y) *minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte* **must not** exceed 1,000 (0.001
Ada).

- This ensures that transactions can be paid for.

**MFRS-02** (y) *minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte* **must not** be negative.

**MFRS-03** (x - "should") To maintain a consistent level of protection against
denial-of-service attacks, *minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte* **should** be adjusted
whenever Plutus Execution prices are adjusted (
*executionUnitPrices[steps/memory]*) and whenever *txFeeFixed* is adjusted.

**MFRS-04** (x - unquantifiable) Any changes to *minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte* *
*must** consider the implications of reducing the cost of a denial-of-service
attack or increasing the maximum transaction fee.

### 2.3. Network Parameters

The overall goals when managing the Cardano Blockchain network parameters are
to:

1. Match the available Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 network capacity to current or
   future traffic demands, including payment transactions, layer 1 DApps,
   sidechain management, and governance needs.
2. Balance traffic demands for different user groups, including payment
   transactions, minters of Fungible/Non-Fungible Tokens, Plutus scripts, DeFi
   developers, Stake Pool Operators, and voting transactions.

_Triggers for Change_

Changes to network parameters may be triggered by:

1. Measured changes in traffic demands over a 2-epoch period (10 days).
2. Anticipated changes in traffic demands.
3. Community requests.

_Counter-indicators_

Changes may need to be reversed and/or should not be enacted in the event of:

- Excessive block propagation delays.
- Stake pools being unable to handle traffic volume.
- Scripts being unable to complete execution.

_Core Metrics_

All decisions on parameter changes should be informed by:

- Block propagation delay profile.
- Traffic volume (block size over time).
- Script volume (size of scripts and execution units).
- Script execution cost benchmarks.
- Block propagation delay/diffusion benchmarks.

Detailed benchmarking results are required to confirm the effect of any changes
on mainnet performance or behavior prior to enactment. The effects of different
transaction mixes must be analyzed, including normal transactions, Plutus
scripts, and governance actions.

#### Guardrails

**NETWORK-01** (x - "should") No individual network parameter **should** change
more than once per two epochs.

**NETWORK-02** (x - "should") Only one network parameter **should** be changed
per epoch unless they are directly correlated, e.g., per-transaction and
per-block memory unit limits.

_Changes to Specific Network Parameters_

_Block Size (maxBlockBodySize)_

The maximum size of a block, in Bytes.

#### Guardrails

**MBBS-01** (y) *maxBlockBodySize* **must not** exceed 122,880 Bytes (120KB).

**MBBS-02** (y) *maxBlockBodySize* **must not** be lower than 24,576 Bytes (
24KB).

**MBBS-03** (x - "exceptional circumstances") *maxBlockBodySize* **must not** be
decreased, other than in exceptional circumstances where there are potential
problems with security, performance, or functionality.

**MBBS-04** (~ - no access to existing parameter values) *maxBlockBodySize* *
*must** be large enough to include at least one transaction (that is,
*maxBlockBodySize* **must** be at least *maxTxSize*).

**MBBS-05** (x - "should") *maxBlockBodySize* **should** be changed by at most
10,240 Bytes (10KB) per epoch (5 days), and preferably by 8,192 Bytes (8KB) or
less per epoch.

**MBBS-06** (x - "should") The block size **should not** induce an additional
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) round trip. Any increase beyond this must be
backed by performance analysis, simulation, and benchmarking.

**MBBS-07** (x - "unquantifiable") The impact of any change to
*maxBlockBodySize* **must** be confirmed by detailed benchmarking/simulation and
not exceed the requirements of the block diffusion/propagation time budgets, as
described below. Any increase to *maxBlockBodySize* must also consider future
requirements for Plutus script execution (*maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps]*)
against the total block diffusion target of 3s with 95% block propagation within
5s. The limit on maximum block size may be increased in the future if this is
supported by benchmarking and monitoring results.

_Transaction Size (maxTxSize)_

The maximum size of a transaction, in Bytes.

#### Guardrails

**MTS-01** (y) *maxTxSize* **must not** exceed 32,768 Bytes (32KB).

**MTS-02** (y) *maxTxSize* **must not** be negative.

**MTS-03** (~ - no access to existing parameter values) *maxTxSize* **must not**
be decreased.

**MTS-04** (~ - no access to existing parameter values) *maxTxSize* **must not**
exceed *maxBlockBodySize*.

**MTS-05** (x - "should") *maxTxSize* **should not** be increased by more than
2,560 Bytes (2.5KB) in any epoch, and preferably **should** be increased by
2,048 Bytes (2KB) or less per epoch.

**MTS-06** (x - "should") *maxTxSize* **should not** exceed 1/4 of the block
size.

_Memory Unit Limits (maxBlockExecutionUnits[memory],
maxTxExecutionUnits[memory])_

The limit on the maximum number of memory units that can be used by Plutus
scripts, either per-transaction or per-block.

#### Guardrails

**MTEU-M-01** (y) *maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]* **must not** exceed 40,000,000
units.

**MTEU-M-02** (y) *maxTxExecutionUnits[memory]* **must not** be negative.

effect following the hard fork. Existing updatable protocol parameters may also
be deprecated by the hard fork, in which case the guardrails become obsolete for
all future changes.

#### Guardrails

**HARDFORK-01** (~ - no access to existing parameter values) The major protocol
version **must** be the same as or one greater than the major version that will
be enacted immediately prior to this change. If the major protocol version is

version **must** be no less than the minor version that will be enacted
immediately prior to this change.

**HARDFORK-03** (~ - no access to existing parameter values) At least one of the
protocol versions (major or minor or both) **must** change.

*and/or term** governance actions **must not** be ratified until Ada holders
have ratified through an on-chain governance action the Final Constitution.

### 6. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON NEW CONSTITUTION OR GUARDRAILS SCRIPT ACTIONS

### 9. GUARDRAILS DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD

_Interim Period_

The Interim Period begins with the Chang Hard-Fork and ends after a
community-ratified Final Constitution is enacted on-chain. Throughout the
Interim Period, technical and constitution-enforced triggers will progressively
turn on the features of CIP-1694.

_Interim Period Technical Rollout:_

- The Chang Hard Fork will enable three initial CIP-1694 governance actions and
  enable the representative framework to be established.

These actions are the **"Info"**, **"Hard-fork initiation"**, and **"Protocol
parameter changes"** actions.

Ada holders will be able to register as and delegate to dReps immediately after
the hard fork but, as described in CIP-1694, dRep voting will not be available,
except on **"Info"** actions. This ensures that Ada holders have sufficient time
to choose their voting delegations.

SPOs will be able to vote as described in CIP-1694.

**"Hard-fork initiation"** and **"Protocol parameter changes"** actions will
also be ratified by the Constitutional Committee.

Ada holders will be able to withdraw their staking rewards as usual.

- A subsequent hard fork, ratified by the Constitutional Committee and SPOs,
  shortly after the Chang Hard Fork, will enable the four remaining CIP-1694
  governance actions:

    - **"Treasury withdrawals"**,
    - **"Motion of no-confidence"**,
    - **"Update constitutional committee and/or threshold and/or terms"**, and
    - **"New constitution or guardrails script"**.

At this point, dRep voting will be enabled and staking rewards can only be
withdrawn if the Ada holder has delegated their vote (including to the
pre-defined Abstain/No Confidence voting options).

#### Guardrails

**INTERIM-01** (x) To provide sufficient time for dReps to register and campaign
and for Ada holders to choose their initial voting delegations, at least 18
epochs (90 days, or approximately 3 months) **must** elapse after the Chang hard
fork before the subsequent hard fork can be ratified. Once the subsequent hard
fork is enacted, dRep voting can occur as described in CIP-1694.

**INTERIM-02** (x) Treasury withdrawals **must not** be ratified until there is
a community-approved Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem budget then in effect pursuant
to a previous on-chain governance action.

**INTERIM-03** (x) Treasury withdrawals **must** be consistent with the
community-approved Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budget(s).

**INTERIM-04** (x) Ada holders **must** have ratified the Final Constitution as
specified in Appendix II before ratifying any other proposed **"new
constitution"**, **"update constitutional committee and/or threshold and/or
terms"**, and **"motion of no-confidence"** governance actions.

**INTERIM-05** (x) **"New guardrails script"** actions that are consistent with
the Interim Constitution may be ratified during the interim period, provided the
Interim Constitution itself is not changed.
